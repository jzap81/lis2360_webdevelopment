        <h1>Women Taking Over the World</h1>
        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        <p>With March quickly approaching comes the arrival of Women's History month. While there have been many female icons over the years, the actual word, feminist, has become somewhat of a taboo subject. Emma Watson said it best in her speech as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador on gender equality to the United Nations when she said, "I have realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonmous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop". However, in reality the idea of feminism has nothing to do with "hating men".</p>
        <p>Feminism by definition is: <em><strong>"The beleif that men and women should have equal rights and oppertunities. It is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes"</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>Today, we are surrounded by gender based assumptions and sterotypes that make female qualities seem lesser than. Emma Watson says that [she] started questioning gender-based assumptions when at eight [she] was confused at being called "bossy", because [she] wanted to direct the plays [they] would put on for [their] parents- but the boys were not. When at 14 [she] started being sexualized by certain elements of the press. When at 15 [her] girlfriends started droppping out of their sports teams because they didnt want to appear "muscly". When at 18 [her] male friends were unable to express their feelings.</p>
        <p>It was then that she decided she was a feminist, a decision that seemed pretty uncomplicated. However, the word feminism has become an unpopular word. This begs the question why has the word "feminism" become such an uncomfortable one?</p>

    <h2><em>Gender Equality is for Everybody</em></h2>
    <p>It is often perceived that gender equality is just an issue for women. However, men, its your issue too. Many young men suffering from mental illness feel unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less of a man. In fact, in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between the ages of 20-49 year of age; eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and coronary heart disease. Men being imprisoned by gender sterotypes is not often talked about, but when men are made free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. To conclude her speech to the United Nations, Emma Watson says, "If men dont have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won't feel compelled to be submissive. If men dont have to control, women wont have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong...It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are- we can all be freer..."</p>
