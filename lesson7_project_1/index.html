                <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
                <p>With March quickly approaching comes the arrival of Women's History month. While there have been many female icons over the years, the actual word, feminist, has become somewhat of a taboo subject. Emma Watson said it best in her speech as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador on gender equality to the United Nations when she said, "I have realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonmous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop". However, in reality the idea of feminism has nothing to do with "hating men".</p>
                <p>Today, we are surrounded by gender based assumptions and sterotypes that make female qualities seem lesser than. Emma Watson says that [she] started questioning gender-based assumptions when at eight [she] was confused at being called "bossy", because [she] wanted to direct the plays [they] would put on for [their] parents- but the boys were not. When at 14 [she] started being sexualized by certain elements of the press. When at 15 [her] girlfriends started droppping out of their sports teams because they didnt want to appear "muscly". When at 18 [her] male friends were unable to express their feelings.</p>
                <p>It was then that she decided she was a feminist, a decision that seemed pretty uncomplicated. However, the word feminism has become an unpopular word. This begs the question why has the word "feminism" become such an uncomfortable one?</p>

                    <p>Feminism by definition is: <em><strong>"The beleif that men and women should have equal rights and oppertunities. It is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes"</strong></em>.</p>
