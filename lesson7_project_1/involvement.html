            <p>It is often perceived that gender equality is just an issue for women. However, men, its your issue too. Many young men suffering from mental illness feel unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less of a man. In fact, in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between the ages of 20-49 year of age; eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and coronary heart disease. Men being imprisoned by gender sterotypes is not often talked about, but when men are made free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. To conclude her speech to the United Nations, Emma Watson says, "If men dont have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won't feel compelled to be submissive. If men dont have to control, women wont have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong...It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are- we can all be freer..."</p>
